# Friskainet
Friskainet is a Discord bot written in JavaScript with the main purpose of improving my coding skills.

### F.A.Q
#### Why that name?
To be honest the name came from a chat that a friend and I were having about an old bot he had from a videogame and I asked him if I could use that.

It also comes from Free [Skynet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skynet_(Terminator)>).

#### Why the RuneScape gnome as logo?
It was the first image that I used for my bot and I think that it's a funny one. I haven't played RuneScape in my life and I'm not affiliated with Jagex either.
